# LanguageTranslation

This project uses two different datasets, one from Kaggle and one from Hugging Face to perform language translation from english to french. 

Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devicharith/language-translation-englishfrench
Hugging Face Link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/opus_books

Steps to run:
1) When running the code LanguageTransltor_RNN make sure to use the datasets in the datasets folder containing the eng_-french dataset.
2) The LanguageTranslator_T5 does not require any dataset since it uses the Hugging Face dataset.
3) Run all the code cells and you can test your inputs.
